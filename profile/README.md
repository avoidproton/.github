# Avoid Proton
[Proton](https://proton.me/) is an email service that has become increasingly popular with people seeking privacy and security, and those wishing to resist mass surveillance. However, we urge you to avoid using Proton without first understanding the serious risks involved. We offer a comprehensive critique of this evolving phenomenon in conjunction with the earlier work of others.

This is a project created by a middle school student who uses English as a second language, and we are asking for the community's help.
